# Rock Paper Scissors Arena

## About the Project:

This is a game of rock paper scissors against the computer. This project was
done to sharpen my knowledge in js and practice using DOM manipulation with event listeners.

## Tech Stack:

HTML and JavaScript.

## What I learned:

Completeing this project taught me a lot about using the DOM in javascript to create and manipulate HTML elements as well as using event listeners. I created buttons and the UI text through javascript and attached event listeners to the buttons to track and display score alongside a victory/defeat message.

## Status:

While fun to work on I don't see myself coming back to this project as it served it's main purpose of practicing JS. If I did ever decide to come back I would clean up the UI and make it easier to for the player to understand the results of their selections. I would also try to implement some sort of reset state after a victory or defeat has been decided.
